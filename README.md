Hey! 

Thank you for installing, some important information is listed below:

=== Preambles ===

This tool is a WIP this is the V1.0.0 release. You may encounter some bugs and glitches - if you do please reachout to me and I can revise it for the next version
I am working on this tool in the background so updates may be slow but if they are urgent I will fix ASAP.
I am planning on updating the tool to include OCR detection so it's more usuable across other older PDF types.

== What is this tool for? ==

The primary focus of this tool is to cut that damn manual task of interpreting information off of a PDF. In my role I have to look at tons of PDF's take values/info from them and compile them, typically in excel. So this tool helps cut down the manualness of it.
